 Hello Chip,

> As mentioned, I used x11vnc for my test.

>
> *Installing the VNC server*
> Pretty straightforward step. Just be sure first to update your package
> manager index first.
>
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install x11vnc
>
>
> *Configuring the VNC server*
> Once the package is installed, you may want to setup a password for
> security purposes. To do that, enter:
>
> x11vnc -storepasswd /PATH/TO/THE/PASSWORD/FILE
>
> It can be in /etc/x11vnc.passwd, /home/bsp/password_for_vnc, etc. wherever
> it makes sense to you. But just to be sure that the bsp user has
> read-access to the file whatever its location, simply enter the following
> command:
>
> chmod a+r /PATH/TO/THE/PASSWORD/FILE, where a+r means (add read privilege
> to all)
>
> *Launching a VNC server instance*
>
> Then, in order to luanch an instance of the VNC server, enter the
> following command:
>
> x11vnc -auth guest -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -display :0 -rfbauth
> /PATH/TO/THE/PASSWORD/FILE -rfbport 5900 -shared, where "display :0" is
> actually the display number used by default by the Ubuntu player.

> You might need to tweak this command. It worked for me, but I can't
> guarantee it will work for you. You can of course change the port if some
> other application is using port 5900.
>
> *Creating a SSH tunnel*
>
> Once that is setup, you can access the player securely via SSH by binding
> the port 5900 of the dedicated player to a port of your local computer with
> the following command:
>
> ssh -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 -N -l USERNAME IP_ADDRESS
>
> I am using OpenSSH on Cygwin for this. It is possible to configure PuTTy
> in a similar fashion using the interface, but I made no test.
>
> Where:
>
>    - The first instance of 5900 is your local computer port,
>    - The second instance is the port of the VNC server on the player,
>    - USERNAME is the username possessing sudo privilege (it can be root,
>    bsp or some other user),
>    - IP_ADDRESS is the IP address of your player.
>
> If you are connecting to a player that has no direct access to the
> Internet (such as being in a local network), please make sure that you can
> access by allowing a port redirection from the router to the player itself
> or by connecting via a VPN.
>
> *Using a VNC client*
>
> Once the connection is established, use a VNC client on your local
> computer and login to 127.0.0.1:5900.
>
> *Running x11vnc at startup*
>
> If you want for x11vnc server to start up at every reboot, enter the
> following command on your player:
>
> sudo crontab -u bsp -e
>
> It will ask you to choose which text editor you want and then you will be
> able to modify the cron jobs file. In it, simply enter:
>
> @reboot x11vnc -auth guest -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -display :0
> -rfbauth /PATH/TO/THE/PASSWORD/FILE -rfbport 5900 -shared, basically the
> same command as before, but with @reboot.
>
> *As a note, I said on the phone to add the cronjob for the root user, but
> it is in fact for the bsp user.*
>
> I hope this will help you. If you have problems, don't hesitate to contact
> me again.

> Have an excellent weekend.
